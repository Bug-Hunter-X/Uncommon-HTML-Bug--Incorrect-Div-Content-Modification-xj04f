This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML involving the modification of a div's content using JavaScript.  The `bug.html` file shows an attempt to modify div content using `textContent`, which unexpectedly fails because it treats the content as plain text and strips any existing HTML structure. The `bugSolution.html` shows the correct way, using `innerHTML`, which enables proper HTML parsing and modification within the div.
